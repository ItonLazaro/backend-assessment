# Storia Backend Developer Assessment

## Overview
This assessment is designed to evaluate the candidate's problem-solving abilities, understanding of backend development concepts, and adaptability in using unfamiliar languages or frameworks. The focus is on the process of solving the problem rather than the code quality.

## Assignment
Develop a simple RESTful API for a basic task management application.

### Features to Implement
1. **User Authentication:** Implement a user authentication system (sign-up, login, logout).
2. **Task Management:** Enable users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
3. **Task Prioritization:** Add functionality to prioritize tasks.
4. **Data Persistence:** Store tasks and user information persistently (using any database of choice).
5. **Documentation:** Provide basic documentation on how to set up and use the API.

## Recommended Technologies
- **Primary Language:** Choose a language you're less familiar with. For example, if experienced in PHP, try Ruby or C#.
- **Framework:** Use a corresponding framework (e.g., Ruby on Rails for Ruby, Flask or Django for Python).
- **Database:** Any SQL or NoSQL database.
- **Additional Tools:** Docker (optional), Postman or similar tools for API testing.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Problem Solving:** Effectiveness in approaching and solving the given task.
- **Adaptability:** Ability to cope with an unfamiliar language or framework.
- **Code Organization:** Organization and readability of the code.
- **Documentation:** Clarity and completeness of setup and usage instructions.
- **Bonus Points:** Implementation of additional features (e.g., task deadlines, notifications for overdue tasks).

## Submission Instructions
- Fork the provided repository and commit your work to your fork.
- Notify the interviewer upon completion and provide access to your repository.

## Additional Notes
- Feel free to ask questions for clarifications.
- The focus is on problem-solving and learning ability, not solely on a fully functional API.
