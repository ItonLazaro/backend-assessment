# Backend Developer Assessment

## Scenario
You are part of a team tasked with building a backend for a new productivity app. The app is designed to help users manage their tasks more effectively. As a backend developer, your job is to create a RESTful API that will handle task management and user authentication.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication System
- Implement endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
- Ensure secure handling of user credentials.

### 2. Task Management Endpoints
- Create endpoints to add, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.
- Each task should have attributes like title, description, creation date, and status.

### 3. Data Storage
- Choose an appropriate database for storing user and task data.
- Ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval.

### 4. Documentation
- Provide clear documentation on how to set up and use the API.

## Technology Stack
- **Primary Language:** Use a language that is not your primary language of expertise. For example, if you are proficient in PHP, try using Ruby or Python.
- **Framework:** Depending on the language chosen, use an appropriate framework (e.g., Ruby on Rails for Ruby, Flask or Django for Python).
- **Database:** SQL (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (like MongoDB).
- **Testing:** Write basic tests to ensure your API endpoints work as expected.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Problem Solving:** How you approach the task and solve challenges.
- **Adaptability:** Your ability to work with unfamiliar languages or frameworks.
- **Code Quality:** Organization, readability, and maintainability of your code.
- **Documentation:** The clarity of your setup and usage instructions.

## Extra Credit
- **Advanced Features:** Implement advanced features like task prioritization, deadlines, or notifications for overdue tasks.
- **Security:** Add features like token-based authentication or rate limiting to enhance API security.
- **Deployment:** Containerize the application using Docker and provide instructions for deployment.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage for your application.

## Submission
- Fork the provided repository and commit your work to your fork.
- Upon completion, notify the interviewer and share access to your repository.

## Notes
- Feel free to ask clarifying questions.
- Emphasis is on your approach to problem-solving and learning, not just on delivering a fully functional API.
